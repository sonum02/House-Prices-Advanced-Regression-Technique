# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Technique
My attempt to solve House Price competition on Kaggle
I am new to data science so want to work on Kaggle to learn and get experience. This is my second project on Kaggle after Titanic problem
Worked on following on Day 1:
	1. Get data in Azure ML studio
	2. There are 80 columns so reduce that number to top10:
		a. Feature selection / Filter based on feature selection
		b. Study how many types of "Filter based on feature selection" are there and which one you have to use.
    c. Check how each selected feature/column is related to SalesPrice
